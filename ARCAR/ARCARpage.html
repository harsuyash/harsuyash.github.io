        <!-- PROJECT BACKGROUND -->
        <p class="headings">Background: Mentorship Project</p>
        <p class="content">Under the mentorship of an AR designer at Google, The project was done in a duration of six weeks from competitor analysis, problem identification, prototyping to suggesting scalable guidlines.  In the times of COVID 19, testing was done through convenience sampling on relatives (emergent AR users).</p>
    
        
        <!-- ABOUT AR -->
        <p class="headings">About Augmented Reality</p>
        <p class="content">Augmented Reality (AR) is about placing virtual objects in the real world that could be manipulated in real time through an interface. AR has had me fascinated with the immersive experience and the interface that goes beyond the 2D screen, towards tangibile interactions and real&nbsp;life&nbsp;metaphors.</p>
        
        
        <!-- GOALS -->
        <p class="headings">Goals: Designing for, not with AR</p>
        <p class="content">Through this project, the main aim was to learn about the interaction design problems in AR and explore solutions to them. Learning to prototype for AR and understanding the design process for it was another important learning goal.</p>

       <p class="content">It is difficult to switch focus from 2D screen space to 3D space. As the paper could not bring out the 3D aspect of AR, users mostly interacted with the buttons permanently on screen and had no knowledge of being able to interact with the parts themselves due to lack of clicking affordance in the objects.   </p>

        <p class="content">Some insights could be drawn from these paper prototypes about how people could interact with screen space elements and whether they could navigate through the different parts of the car. However, to get any deeper insights about how people could interact with AR elements, I had to jump into making quick working prototypes.  </p>

        <p class="content">During the time of lockdown due to COVID19, I asked my parents to use the application. I could get some useful insights as they were not familiar with AR. It made me think from someone’s perspective who doesn’t even have a conceptual model for AR in their mind.
            <br>
            <br>
            And after looking at several reviews and feedback on existing apps online, I found out that there are many such people. I had to make several iterations of the app just for the placing the car in the environment and visit back to the journey map to document more&nbsp;specific&nbsp;problems.

From the previous insights, it was clear that these had to be in the world space for a better immersive experience.

The umbrella problem of visibility has several factora affecting it like 
            <br><br>
            -Text element could be outside the screen
            <br><br>
            -The real world background is by dynamic and cluttured

        <p class="content"> As observed in the rudimentary testing, the users were not aware if the 3D objects in the world space could be interacted with and what could happen if they tapped on them. The use case for this in our project was where users should click on a part to know more about it or in some cases, view in exploded view. 
            <br><br>
            Apart from the affordance, it is difficult to control objects in a 3D space using a 2D screen. The position of the objects are not fixed with reference to the screen and accidental taps on screen can lead to errors.

I understood the current trends in AR with respect to the use cases, interaction techniques, and technological limitations. I learnt to think from the user's perspective, especially those who are unfamiliar with AR. I also learnt to prototype in AR using Unity engine with AR foundation and AR Core plugins and C# script. Apart from this I learnt the importance of storytelling and&nbsp;communication.
